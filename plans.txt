Laptop/Desktop Layout
- Navigation bar at the top 


Phone Layout 
- Hamburger menu at the top that expands and contracts 

Ideas
- Make guides for the website, for example for react, SQL, typescript, swift
- For the front page have pictures with transitions between them 


Things to think about /fix
- If the page loads in too slowly, try a woff font instead (didn't really help much before)
- Do a lighthouse test at the end 
- use cubic-bezier animation for how proficient my skills in languages are
- Allow users to customize parts of the background like a color picker for the background gradient (have a little preview before so they can see what it will look like)

Projects
