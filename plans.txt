Laptop/Desktop Layout
- Navigation bar at the top 


Phone Layout 
- Hamburger menu at the top that expands and contracts 

Ideas
- Make guides for the website, for example for react, SQL, typescript, swift


Things to think about /fix
- If the page loads in too slowly, try a woff font instead (didn't really help much before)
- Do a lighthouse test at the end 
- use cubic-bezier animation for how proficient my skills in languages are
- Allow users to customize parts of the background like a color picker for the background gradient (have a little preview before so they can see what it will look like)
- Have a custom domain 

Projects
- Graphics Project
- Discord bot
- recipe manager
- movie display react app 

Projects page Layout
- normal header
- side bar with anchors to each of the individual Projects
- each project has a description with images and a link to the github source code
- for the images for each project, have an image gallery with small images that when clicked on become big (do the arrow thing as well)
